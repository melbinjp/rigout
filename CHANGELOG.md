## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Automated Jules PR review (`scripts/jules_review.py`): posts a code review
  comment on every PR and auto-approves it when no blocking issues are
  found, since branch protection's "require approval of the most recent
  push" rule otherwise cannot be satisfied by the PR author themselves.
- Unit tests for the Cloudflare quick-tunnel bootstrap (`start_cloudflare_tunnel`,
  `resolve_public_mcp_url`), covering URL extraction and both failure paths.
- `.github/dependabot.yml` for automated dependency and GitHub Actions updates.

### Fixed
- `LocalTerminalSession` hung indefinitely on Windows: `cmd.exe /q` suppresses
  input echo but still prints the shell prompt, so the completion sentinel
  arrived prefixed (`C:\path>__RIGOUT_DONE_xxx__ 0`) instead of at the start
  of the line, and was discarded as a stale echo instead of being recognized.
- CI: removed a bogus `pip install curl` step in the Agent Connection Audit
  workflow (`curl` is a system binary, not a PyPI package).
- CI: pinned macOS runners to `macos-15` after GitHub's `macos-latest` ->
  `macos-26` migration caused runner-acquisition failures; updated branch
  protection's required status checks to match the renamed jobs.
